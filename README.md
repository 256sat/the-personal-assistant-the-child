Gant's is an artificial intelligence personal assistant program designed to provide assistance and answers to a variety of questions and inquiries. This program is characterized as a simple model of building a curious child who learns from the user each time.

When you ask a question to Gant's, its initial answer may be "I don't know the answer." This reflects the fact that at the beginning of the project, it does not have any prior knowledge. Through this response, the user is encouraged to provide the correct answer to the question. Afterwards, Gant's asks the user to write the correct answer to the question and stores it in a text file named "knowledge".

Once Gant's learns the correct answer to a specific question, it will be able to respond to similar inquiries in subsequent times. The program relies on machine learning algorithms and natural language processing to analyze context, understand different concepts, and provide appropriate answers.

Consequently, Gant's knowledge is enhanced and its knowledge base is expanded each time it learns from the user. The text file "knowledge" containing the questions and answers can be leveraged to enhance its capabilities and improve its performance in providing appropriate answers.

In this way, Gant's is developed to be an effective personal assistant that learns from its interactions with the user and is capable of providing accurate and comprehensive answers to future inquiries.
